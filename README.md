# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI Bot

This is a single-player web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using React.js for the frontend and FastAPI for the backend. The app is deployed on Render and Netlify, respectively.

## Features

- Single-player mode: play against an AI bot that uses the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves
- Responsive design: the app adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- Interactive gameplay: click on the board to make a move
- Persistent game state: the app stores the current game state in the browser's local storage, so you can resume the game later

## Technologies

- React.js: a popular frontend library for building user interfaces
- FastAPI: a modern, fast, web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ (deployed on Render)
- Netlify: a cloud platform for hosting and deploying web apps and static websites
- Minimax algorithm: a recursive algorithm used in game theory to determine the best move for a player

## How to use

To play the game, simply visit the app URL on your web browser. The app starts in single-player mode, where you play against the AI bot. The bot uses the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves.

Once you start playing, you can click on a cell to make a move. The app will automatically switch turns between the player and the bot and display the game outcome when the game is over.

The app does not allow the user to choose new symbols. The player uses the 'X' symbol and the bot uses the 'O' symbol.

The app also stores the current game state in the browser's local storage, so you can resume the game later if you close the browser window.
